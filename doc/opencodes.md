## The world as a field of data

The exhibitions [OpenCodes](https://zkm.de/en/exhibition/2017/10/open-codes) at the [ZKM](https://open-codes.zkm.de/en), Karlsruhe, Germany, shows a broad range of digital artworks. For an computer engineering expert like me many (but not all) of the underlying approaches, algorithms or implementations are commonplace. However, the creative processes expressed in the artworks are nevertheless fascinating and inspiring.

In this project I try to show some technical background of the installations on display by presenting a collection of programming examples related to different aspects of the digital works.
The programming is based upon the language [Python3](https://www.python.org/). Python is freely available for all major platforms and is quite powerfull while still easy to understand and learn.

Digital artworks typically make use of technical interfaces to communicate with the observers - or users. These interfaces translate from digital signals - in other words: numbers - generated by the machinery built by the artist - normally some kind of computer - to human senses. For example, a video screen, a digital audio encoder, a virtual or augmented reality system. Some interfaces translate in the other direction by sensing human activities. They create numbers from physical motion of our body or from our brain activity. The more complete the translation and the better the quality the more "real" is our interaction with the digital objects. 

But there are also a number of works which do not use digital interfaces directly but traditional media like paper printings or written text. Still they demonstrate aspects of our digital surroundings - often results of "artificial intelligence" (AI): 	machines doing things like we do.

To make AI work, enormous amounts of data have to be fed into machine learning algorithms so they learn over time what we cannot teach them directly in the traditional form of imperative algoriithms (programs). Data is becoming more and more important as a means to develop the tools of the digital age. It is obvious that the term "Knowledge is Power" has a brand-new meaning in todays world. When data is knowledge, allowing private treasures of data at a large scale is a big risk for democracy. Concsequently, the OpenCodes exhibition has a strong focus on data, in particular during its second phase called "The World as a Field of Data". OpenCodes also targets education on the core digital topics: data and code. This project aims to help in this education.

Not all of our human senses can equally well be interfaced by digital technology. However for our primary senses of vision and hearing it works quite well. Also our "symbolic sense" (which isn't one of the typical senses) is a very good candidate: human language in written form was used even before the two from above and machines start to talk and understand what we say. 
Interfaces to taste, smell, skin sensing and balance are by far not on-par with the others.

## Artworks and Topics
The topic "data" is introduced by the installation of Weibel and Lölkes: [The World as a Field of Data](https://zkm.de/de/ausstellung/2017/10/open-codes). Data are taken from a large number of publicly avaialable feeds and displayed in a (more or less) uniform style.

> The vast number of electronic interfaces like smartphones, computers, and screens, which accompany people every day in doctors’ surgeries, at home, in offices, at the stock exchange, airports, or railway stations, is overwhelming proof that navigating by the sun, moon, and stars has long since been replaced by satellites and other technological instruments. 
People living in the digital age don’t navigate by the position of the stars and sun; they follow where digital devices lead them, which receive information from the cell tower on the horizon and orbiting satellites in space. The installation The World as a Field of Data confronts us with this field of data that accompanies us around the clock in a deliberately exaggerated way.
Data fields are omnipresent. All the information that is generated as a result of our interaction on the Net and in the real world are assembled on around 40 screens, which hang in the air as a data cloud at ZKM’s Atrium 8.
 
 Refik Anadol uses EEG-data from a human brain to generate an optical visualization in [Melting Memories](https://zkm.de/de/melting-memories). This requires advanced visualization techniques and demonstrates a variety of contexts in which we can use the same data.

> Melting Memories debuts new advances in technology that enable visitors to experience aesthetic interpretations of motor movements inside a human brain. 
The work grows out of the artist’s experiments with the advanced technology tools provided by the Neuroscape Laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco. Neuroscape is a neuroscience center focusing on technology creation and scientific research on brain function of both healthy and impaired individuals. Anadol gathers data on the neural mechanisms of cognitive control from an EEG (electroencephalogram) that measures changes in brain wave activity and provides evidence of how the brain functions over time. These data sets constitute the foundation for the unique algorithms that the artist needs for the multidimensional visual structure on display.

Rybn used a fairly traditional display style of stock market data to introduce their special codes for trading algorithms used in [ADM-XI](https://zkm.de/de/adm-xi). This is also a very good example for fundamentals of programming.

>ADM XI is an independent research platform for experimental algorithmic trading engineering that challenges the dogma of neoclassical economics. It created a collection of heretic, irrational, and experimental operating trading algorithms that are released to compete with each other on a marketplace hosted and organized by RYBN.ORG. 
In this contest, benefits are no longer driven by prices and other economic instruments, but by living organisms – soil, plants, bacteria; by supraterrestrial laws – environmental, astronomical, astrological; and by ancient or forbidden knowledge – esoterica, magic, geomancy. 
All the algorithms follow their own non-mercantile and obsessive logic: some attempt to produce total and irreversible chaos; others try to influence market prices to make them look a given geometric shape. 

Jörn Müller-Quade gives a close combination of math and visual art with [code beautiful like a clock](). Only a few lines of code are needed to generate images of particular beauty.

>Many people find mechanical clocks appealing. No such aesthetic appeal is ascribed to computer programs, although they are mechanical in a similar way: fixed, predefined commands are executed to yield a result.
The “mechanics” of computer programs play out on a time scale that lies outside of human perception. While many programs have reaction times that are perceptible to us, basic commands are completed a billion times faster during this time. This work is intended to bridge these extreme time scales, making it possible to experience the mechanical character of computer programs.
The exhibit is composed of three units: on the left is the program code, with an emphasis on the command that is being executed at a given moment. In the middle, the “inner life” of the processor with its registers, execution unit and memory is displayed in the act of executing a basic command. On the right, the result is visualized.
A control knob changes the processing speed: when it is slowed down, individual steps become discernible, but their visible result is delayed. At a high speed, the result appears quickly, but the processor’s individual steps can no longer be observed.
