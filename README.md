# python4zkm
Introductionary Python3 samples related to the very basics of data and visualization.

Inspired by and used during an "action-tour" at the "open codes" exhibition at the ZKM, Karlsruhe, Germany

Tu run all samples you need to install the following modules:

  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * numba
  * pygame
  * random
  * pyttsx3
  *  * On Windows you need pywin32 too for speech 
  * feedparser
  * hashlib
  * html2text
  * quandl
  * wave
  * cv2

In addition, you need the following packages in your system installation:

  * espeak for text to speech output
  * OpenCV3 for image processing
  *  * This is only required for on sampe (trap). It also requires the presence of a
  *  * basic VisualStudio installation. Please refer to the OpenCV3 tutorials like
  *  * here: https://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.htm
  *  For stockParse you need an API key from Quandl (the stock data provider)
  *  * Sign up for a free key at https://quandl.com and add the key to a file
  *  * private.py with the content:
  *  * * quandl_key = "<the key you got from quandl>"
  *  * stockParse imports the key from this private file

The samples have been tested on Linux and Windows using Python3 version 3.6
